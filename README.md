# What a Auto Clicker is?
It spams clicks on the selected Coordinates, We also have a feature that allows for a list of coordinates to be performed and a mega auto clicker that is faster than the base version but is only limited by your computers specs.
# Help / How to use the software
1st click on Find Coordinates.
2nd A window with 2 numbers on will open note down the numbers or leave the window open.
3rd Put the 1st number in the enter x field and the second the 2nd number in the entry field.
